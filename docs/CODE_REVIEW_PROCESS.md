## Review Guidelines

### For Reviewers

#### Best Practices
1. **Be Timely**: Review within 24 hours for urgent changes
2. **Be Thorough**: Check both functionality and quality
3. **Be Constructive**: Provide specific, actionable feedback
4. **Be Learning-Oriented**: Explain reasoning behind suggestions
5. **Be Respectful**: Maintain professional and friendly tone

#### Common Review Patterns

**Security Review**
```python
# ‚ùå Bad: SQL injection risk
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# ‚úÖ Good: Parameterized query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

**Performance Review**
```python
# ‚ùå Bad: N+1 query problem
for position in positions:
    executions = get_executions_for_position(position.id)

# ‚úÖ Good: Single query with join
positions_with_executions = get_positions_with_executions()
```

**Error Handling Review**
```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Silent failure
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except:
    pass

# ‚úÖ Good: Proper error handling
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    raise
```

### For Authors
