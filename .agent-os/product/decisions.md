## 2025-08-17: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Establish Futures Trading Analytics Platform as a position-based trading analytics solution with Flask/SQLite/Redis architecture, focusing on NinjaTrader integration and TradingView chart visualization.

### Context

- Existing codebase with 120+ tests and production-ready infrastructure
- Active user base of NinjaTrader futures traders
- Proven performance with 15-50ms chart loads and reliable data processing
- Current architecture supporting real-time file monitoring and background processing

### Rationale

- Position-based tracking provides superior analytics compared to trade-by-trade analysis
- Flask provides sufficient performance with proper caching and optimization
- SQLite with aggressive indexing meets current scale requirements
- TradingView integration offers professional-grade chart capabilities

## 2025-08-17: Architecture Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Maintain current Flask/SQLite/Redis architecture while focusing on code stabilization and chart data reliability improvements rather than major architectural changes.

### Context

- Current stack delivers 15-50ms chart loads with Redis caching
- SQLite with 8 aggressive indexes handles current data volumes effectively
- Docker containerization with GitHub Actions CI/CD is working well
- Background services with Celery processing data reliably

### Rationale

- Existing architecture is proven and performant for current scale
- Focus should be on improving reliability and user experience
- Major architectural changes would delay core feature improvements
- Current stack can scale to handle significantly more users and data

## 2025-08-17: Development Priorities

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Prioritize chart data reliability and execution processing improvements in Phase 1, followed by advanced analytics in Phase 2, and multi-account features in Phase 3.

### Context

- Users report occasional issues with chart data synchronization
- Execution pairing for complex positions needs improvement
- Codebase has grown organically and needs cleanup
- Position linking feature is highly requested for account copying

### Rationale

- Core functionality must be rock-solid before adding new features
- Chart data reliability directly impacts user trust and adoption
- Code cleanup will improve maintainability and development velocity
- Position linking is a key differentiator for serious traders

## 2025-08-17: Technology Choices

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Continue using TradingView Lightweight Charts for visualization, maintain SQLite as primary database, and enhance Redis caching strategies for improved performance.

### Context

- TradingView Lightweight Charts provides professional-grade chart capabilities
- SQLite with WAL mode and aggressive indexing meets performance requirements
- Redis caching delivers sub-50ms response times for chart data
- Users appreciate the professional look and feel of TradingView charts

### Rationale

- TradingView charts are industry standard and well-maintained
- SQLite is sufficient for current scale and easier to manage than PostgreSQL
- Redis caching is critical for chart performance and user experience
- Changing core technologies would introduce unnecessary risk and complexity

## 2025-08-17: Feature Scope

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Focus on NinjaTrader integration and futures trading specifically, rather than expanding to other platforms or asset classes in the near term.

### Context

- Deep NinjaTrader integration is a key competitive advantage
- Futures trading has specific requirements (multipliers, position tracking)
- Current user base is entirely focused on futures trading
- Other platforms would require significant development resources

### Rationale

- Specialization provides competitive advantage over generic solutions
- NinjaTrader users have specific needs that are well-understood
- Futures trading complexity requires focused expertise
- Better to excel in one area than be mediocre in many
