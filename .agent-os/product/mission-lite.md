# Futures Trading Analytics Platform Mission (Lite)

A Flask-based analytics platform that automatically tracks NinjaTrader futures trading performance using position-based architecture, TradingView charts, and real-time data processing. Transforms raw trading data into actionable insights with 15-50ms chart loads.

**Value**: Eliminates manual performance tracking by automatically processing NinjaTrader data and providing visual trade analysis with market context through TradingView integration.

**Differentiator**: Position-based tracking (quantity flow 0 → +/- → 0) rather than trade-by-trade analysis, with high-performance Redis/SQLite stack delivering sub-50ms response times.
