## Pitch

A Flask-based futures trading analytics platform that helps NinjaTrader users automatically track their trading performance with position-based tracking, TradingView charts, and real-time data processing. The platform transforms raw trading data into actionable insights through automated position flow analysis and interactive visualizations.

## Users

**Primary Users**: Active futures traders who use NinjaTrader for daily trading and want to automatically track their performance without manual data entry.

**User Characteristics**:
- Trade futures contracts regularly (daily/weekly)
- Use NinjaTrader as their primary trading platform
- Need detailed performance analytics beyond basic P&L
- Want to visualize trade execution context with market data
- Require position-based tracking rather than just trade-by-trade analysis
- May copy trades between multiple accounts and need linking capabilities

## The Problem

**Current Pain Points**:
1. **Manual Performance Tracking**: Traders spend significant time manually analyzing their performance across multiple timeframes and instruments
2. **Disconnected Data**: Trading execution data is separate from market context, making it difficult to understand trade quality
3. **Position Complexity**: Traditional trade-by-trade analysis doesn't capture the full picture of position building and scaling strategies
4. **Data Processing Overhead**: Importing and processing large CSV files from NinjaTrader is time-consuming and error-prone
5. **Lack of Visual Context**: No easy way to overlay actual trades on market charts to see execution quality

## Differentiators

**Key Competitive Advantages**:
- **Position-Based Architecture**: Tracks quantity flow (0 → +/- → 0) rather than individual trades, providing true position analytics
- **Automated NinjaTrader Integration**: Seamless CSV import/export with real-time file watching and processing
- **High-Performance Data Pipeline**: SQLite with 8 aggressive indexes + Redis caching delivers 15-50ms chart loads
- **TradingView Integration**: Professional-grade charts with trade overlays for execution analysis
- **Real-Time Processing**: Background services automatically sync and process new data as it arrives
- **Position Overlap Prevention**: Intelligent detection and handling of overlapping positions across timeframes
