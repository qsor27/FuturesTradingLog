# Spec Summary (Lite)

Create a comprehensive import logging page that replaces the existing CSV Manager, displaying full debug-level details for all CSV import executions including row-by-row processing logs, validation errors, and rejected rows with specific failure reasons. The page features red-highlighted failed imports with status badges, expandable detail rows, and action buttons for retry, rollback, viewing affected trades, and downloading error logs to significantly reduce troubleshooting time and enable quick identification and correction of data issues.
