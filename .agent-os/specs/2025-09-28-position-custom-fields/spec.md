> Spec: Position Custom Fields Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This specification defines the implementation of enhanced position detail pages with custom field management capabilities. The system will provide users with the ability to create and manage custom checkbox fields and enhanced notes display, allowing for personalized tracking of position-specific data points that are relevant to their trading strategy and analysis needs.

The enhancement builds upon the existing position detail pages to provide a more flexible and user-configurable interface for tracking custom metrics, observations, and categorical data points that are not part of the standard position data model.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As a trader**, I want to add custom notes to my positions with enhanced display formatting so that I can document my analysis, observations, and lessons learned in a more readable format.

**As a trader**, I want to create custom checkbox fields for my positions so that I can track binary metrics that are specific to my trading strategy (e.g., "News Event", "Gap Trade", "Breakout Setup").

**As a trader**, I want to manage my custom field definitions so that I can add, edit, or remove custom fields as my tracking needs evolve.

**As a trader**, I want my custom fields to appear seamlessly integrated into the position detail pages so that they feel like a natural part of the position data.

**As a trader**, I want my custom fields to only appear after I create them so that the interface remains clean for users who don't need this functionality.

### Secondary User Stories

**As a trader**, I want to see my custom field values clearly displayed on position detail pages so that I can quickly reference my custom tracking data.

**As a trader**, I want to edit custom field values directly from the position detail page so that I can update my tracking data efficiently.
