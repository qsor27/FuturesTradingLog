# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-10-position-execution-chart-arrows/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Chart Enhancement
- Modify `static/js/PriceChart.js` to add execution arrow markers using TradingView Lightweight Charts API
- Implement arrow positioning logic to align execution timestamps with 1m, 5m, and 1h candle boundaries  
- Add interactive tooltip overlay displaying execution details (time, price, quantity, side, P&L, commission)
- Implement arrow-to-table row linking with highlight effects using JavaScript event coordination
- Create responsive arrow sizing and positioning for different chart dimensions and timeframes

### Backend API Enhancement
- Extend existing `/api/executions/<position_id>` endpoint to include chart-specific execution data
- Add execution timestamp precision to millisecond level for accurate chart positioning
- Implement chart timeframe-aware data aggregation (1m, 5m, 1h) to optimize arrow placement
- Ensure execution data includes all required fields for tooltip display and chart integration

### Visual Design Implementation
- Arrow direction logic: left-pointing arrows for entries, right-pointing arrows for exits
- Color coding: green arrows for buy executions, red arrows for sell executions
- Arrow styling consistent with existing TradingView chart theme and Bootstrap 5 design system
- Hover state animations and tooltip positioning to avoid chart obstruction
- Mobile-responsive arrow sizing and touch interaction support

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of execution arrow data only when chart is visible and timeframe is selected
- Client-side caching of execution data to minimize API calls on timeframe changes
- Efficient DOM manipulation for arrow rendering and removal during timeframe switches
- Tooltip debouncing to prevent excessive re-rendering during rapid mouse movement

### Integration Requirements
- Seamless integration with existing position detail page layout and execution breakdown table
- Maintain compatibility with current TradingView chart functionality (crosshair, volume toggle)
- Preserve existing chart performance targets (15-50ms load times) with arrow overlay additions
- Ensure execution table highlighting works with existing pagination and filtering features
