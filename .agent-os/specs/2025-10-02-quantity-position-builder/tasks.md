# Spec Tasks

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Update Execution Deduplication Logic
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for deduplication by `entry_execution_id`
  - [x] 1.2 Modify `_deduplicate_trades()` in `enhanced_position_service_v2.py` to group by `entry_execution_id`
  - [x] 1.3 Add fallback logic for trades without `entry_execution_id`
  - [x] 1.4 Add logging to show before/after deduplication counts
  - [x] 1.5 Verify all tests pass

- [x] 2. Enhance Open Position Detection
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for open position scenarios (running_qty != 0)
  - [x] 2.2 Verify position builder correctly sets `position_status = OPEN`
  - [x] 2.3 Ensure `total_quantity` reflects accurate running quantity for open positions
  - [x] 2.4 Add validation that OPEN positions have non-zero quantity
  - [x] 2.5 Test edge cases (position reversal, partial closes)
  - [x] 2.6 Verify all tests pass

- [x] 3. Create Comprehensive Developer Documentation
  - [x] 3.1 Create `docs/architecture/` directory if not exists
  - [x] 3.2 Write Overview and Core Concepts sections
  - [x] 3.3 Document Deduplication Logic with examples
  - [x] 3.4 Document Position Lifecycle with state machine diagram
  - [x] 3.5 Document FIFO P&L Calculation methodology
  - [x] 3.6 Document Code Architecture and data flow
  - [x] 3.7 Add real-world Examples section
  - [x] 3.8 Review and refine documentation clarity

- [x] 4. Enhance Code Comments
  - [x] 4.1 Add comprehensive docstrings to `position_builder.py`
  - [x] 4.2 Add state transition comments to `quantity_flow_analyzer.py`
  - [x] 4.3 Add deduplication logic comments to `enhanced_position_service_v2.py`
  - [x] 4.4 Document edge cases and assumptions in critical sections
  - [x] 4.5 Add example usage comments for public methods

- [ ] 5. Integration Testing and Validation
  - [ ] 5.1 Write integration test for full position rebuild flow
  - [ ] 5.2 Test with real CSV data containing duplicates
  - [ ] 5.3 Verify position counts match expected (reduced from duplicates)
  - [ ] 5.4 Verify open positions show correct status and quantity
  - [ ] 5.5 Compare before/after metrics (position count, execution count)
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify all tests pass and metrics are accurate
