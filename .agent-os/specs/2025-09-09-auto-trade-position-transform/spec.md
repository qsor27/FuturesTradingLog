# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Auto Trade Position Transform
> Created: 2025-09-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement automatic transformation of trades into positions using the existing position-building infrastructure to eliminate manual rebuild requirements. This feature will ensure positions are immediately available when trades are imported or modified, reducing data lag and improving user experience.

## User Stories

### Automatic Position Creation

As a futures trader, I want my imported trades to automatically create positions, so that I can immediately analyze my performance without waiting for manual rebuilds.

When I upload a CSV file containing trades or manually add trades through the interface, the system automatically processes these trades using the existing position algorithms to create or update positions. The positions become immediately available in the dashboard and charts, with all validation checks and overlap prevention mechanisms working seamlessly.

### Real-time Position Updates

As a trader monitoring live positions, I want position data to update automatically when I modify trade details, so that my analysis reflects current accurate information.

When I edit trade quantities, prices, or timestamps, the system automatically recalculates affected positions using the robust position-building service. The updated positions are immediately reflected in charts and reports without requiring manual intervention.

### Seamless Data Consistency

As a system administrator, I want automatic position building to maintain data integrity, so that the platform remains reliable and accurate.

The automatic transformation uses the same validation algorithms as manual rebuilds, ensuring position boundaries are respected and overlapping trades are handled correctly. Background processing prevents UI blocking during bulk operations while immediate updates provide fast feedback for single-trade changes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Automatic Trade Import Integration** - Hook position building into existing CSV upload and file processing workflows
2. **Real-time Single Trade Processing** - Immediate position updates for individual trade additions or modifications
3. **Background Bulk Processing** - Asynchronous position building for large trade imports to prevent blocking
4. **Incremental Position Updates** - Selective rebuilding of only affected account/instrument combinations for efficiency
5. **Validation Preservation** - Maintain all existing position validation, overlap prevention, and boundary checks

## Out of Scope

- Modifying existing position calculation algorithms or validation logic
- Changes to the database schema or position data structure
- Real-time streaming updates (still batch-based processing)
- Performance optimization of existing position algorithms

## Expected Deliverable

1. Trades imported via CSV automatically generate positions without manual rebuild triggers
2. Manual trade edits immediately update affected positions with validation checks passing
3. Bulk imports process positions in background while maintaining system responsiveness
