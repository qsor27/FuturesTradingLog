# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-auto-trade-position-transform/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Points
- **File Processing Integration**: Hook into `tasks/file_processing.py` to trigger position building after trade imports
- **Trade Route Integration**: Add position update triggers to `routes/trades.py` and `routes/upload.py` 
- **Background Task Extension**: Extend `tasks/position_building.py` with incremental rebuild capabilities
- **Service Layer Enhancement**: Add selective position update methods to `services/enhanced_position_service_v2.py`

### Processing Architecture
- **Immediate Updates**: Synchronous position updates for single trade operations using existing `rebuild_positions_for_account()`
- **Batch Processing**: Asynchronous Celery tasks for bulk imports to prevent UI blocking
- **Incremental Rebuilds**: Target specific account/instrument combinations rather than full rebuilds
- **Cache Integration**: Leverage existing Redis cache invalidation patterns for chart data consistency

### Validation & Error Handling
- **Full Validation Suite**: Maintain all existing position boundary validation and overlap prevention
- **Transaction Safety**: Ensure database consistency during automatic position updates
- **Error Recovery**: Preserve manual rebuild capability as fallback for automatic process failures
- **Logging Integration**: Use existing structured logging for position building audit trails

### Performance Considerations
- **Selective Processing**: Only rebuild positions for affected account/instrument pairs
- **Background Queue Management**: Use existing Celery infrastructure with priority queuing
- **Database Optimization**: Leverage existing database indexes and WAL mode for concurrent access
- **Memory Management**: Process position updates in batches to manage memory usage during large imports

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Health Checks**: Extend existing health check endpoints to monitor automatic position building
- **Metrics Collection**: Track automatic position update success/failure rates
- **Alert Integration**: Use existing error handling to alert on position building failures
- **Consistency Verification**: Maintain scheduled position consistency checks as backup validation
