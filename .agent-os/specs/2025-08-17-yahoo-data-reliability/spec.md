# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Yahoo Finance Data Download Reliability Enhancement
> Created: 2025-08-17
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the reliability and robustness of Yahoo Finance data downloads in the Futures Trading Log application. The current implementation using yfinance has intermittent reliability issues that can impact trading analysis when market data is not available or inconsistent. This spec addresses rate limiting optimization, error handling improvements, network resilience, and data quality validation to ensure traders have consistent access to accurate futures contract data.

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Active Futures Traders

**As a futures trader**, I want reliable access to chart data so that I can make informed trading decisions without worrying about data availability gaps.

**As a futures trader**, I want fast chart loading (maintaining current 15-50ms performance) so that my analysis workflow is not disrupted during critical market moments.

**As a futures trader**, I want clear feedback when data issues occur so that I understand whether the problem is temporary or requires action.

**As a system administrator**, I want comprehensive monitoring of data download health so that I can proactively address issues before they impact traders.

## Spec Scope

### Core Improvements
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Replace fixed 2.5s delays with intelligent rate limiting that responds to Yahoo's actual limits
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error categorization and appropriate retry strategies
- **Network Resilience**: Add circuit breaker patterns, configurable timeouts, and connection pooling
- **Data Quality Validation**: Verify downloaded data integrity and completeness
- **Symbol Mapping Enhancement**: Improve futures contract symbol resolution and validation
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Add detailed logging and health metrics for data download operations

### Performance Requirements
- Maintain existing chart load performance (15-50ms average)
- Support current Redis caching with 14-day TTL
- Handle concurrent data requests efficiently
- Graceful degradation under network stress

### Supported Instruments
- ES, MNQ, YM futures contracts
- Current and historical contract months
- Multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1D)

## Out of Scope

- Migration away from yfinance library (enhancement only)
- Real-time streaming data (continues to use cached/downloaded approach)
- Alternative data providers (Yahoo Finance remains primary source)
- UI/UX changes to existing chart interfaces
- Database schema modifications
- Trading execution or position management features

## Expected Deliverable

A robust, production-ready enhancement to the existing data download system that significantly improves reliability while maintaining current performance characteristics. The solution should include:

1. **Enhanced Data Service**: Updated `services/data_service.py` with improved download logic
2. **Configuration Management**: Flexible settings for rate limiting, retries, and timeouts
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Comprehensive logging and health metrics
4. **Error Recovery**: Intelligent retry mechanisms and graceful failure handling
5. **Documentation**: Updated technical documentation and operational procedures
6. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive tests covering failure scenarios and performance validation
