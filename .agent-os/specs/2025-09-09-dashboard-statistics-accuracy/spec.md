> Spec: Dashboard Statistics Accuracy Fix
> Created: 2025-09-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix accuracy issues in dashboard and statistics calculations by implementing comprehensive testing and resolving inconsistent calculation methods. This ensures reliable performance analytics for traders by standardizing calculation logic across all dashboard components and validating accuracy through extensive test coverage.

## User Stories

### Accurate Dashboard Statistics

As a futures trader, I want the dashboard statistics to show accurate performance metrics, so that I can make informed trading decisions based on reliable data.

When I view the main dashboard reports page, all statistics (win rate, P&L, trade counts, performance metrics) should be calculated consistently using the same underlying logic. The data should match what I see in individual position details and trade records, providing confidence in the platform's analytics.

### Reliable Statistics Page

As a trader analyzing my performance over time, I want the statistics page to display accurate timeframe-based analysis, so that I can track my progress accurately across different periods.

When I select daily, weekly, or monthly views on the statistics page, the aggregated data should be mathematically correct and consistent with the dashboard overview. Calculations should handle edge cases like partial trading periods and empty datasets gracefully.

### Validated Calculation Logic

As a system user, I want comprehensive test coverage for all statistics calculations, so that future updates maintain accuracy and prevent regression issues.

Before any statistics-related deployment, automated tests should verify calculation accuracy across multiple scenarios including empty data, single trades, multiple accounts, and various timeframes. Tests should cross-validate results between different calculation methods to ensure consistency.

## Spec Scope

1. **Dashboard Statistics Validation** - Audit and fix all statistics calculations in the main reports dashboard
2. **Statistics Page Accuracy** - Resolve inconsistencies in timeframe-based statistics calculations  
3. **Missing Method Implementation** - Implement any missing database methods referenced in reports routes
4. **Calculation Standardization** - Standardize win rate, P&L, and performance calculations across components
5. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Create extensive unit and integration tests for all statistics logic

## Out of Scope

- Database schema changes or migrations
- UI/UX improvements to dashboard layout or design  
- New statistical metrics or advanced analytics features
- Performance optimization of existing calculation algorithms
- Historical data correction or backfilling

## Expected Deliverable

1. All dashboard and statistics calculations produce accurate, consistent results validated by tests
2. Comprehensive test suite covers all statistics methods with edge cases and regression prevention
3. Zero missing method errors when accessing any dashboard or statistics page functionality
