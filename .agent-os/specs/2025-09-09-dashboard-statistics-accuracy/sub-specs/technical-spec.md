# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-dashboard-statistics-accuracy/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Statistics Method Audit and Standardization
- **Method Verification**: Audit all statistics calculation methods in `scripts/TradingLog_db.py` for accuracy and consistency
- **Calculation Standardization**: Standardize win rate, P&L, and performance calculations to use consistent formulas across all methods
- **Missing Method Resolution**: Implement or fix any missing database methods referenced in `routes/reports.py` 
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensure statistics calculations align with position-based architecture from `services/enhanced_position_service_v2.py`

### Database Query Optimization
- **Query Consistency**: Standardize SQL queries across `get_statistics()`, `get_overview_statistics()`, and repository methods
- **Parameter Handling**: Ensure consistent date filtering, account filtering, and timeframe aggregation logic
- **Result Formatting**: Standardize return data structures between different statistics methods
- **Edge Case Handling**: Properly handle empty datasets, single trade scenarios, and invalid date ranges

### Test Infrastructure Implementation
- **Test Database Setup**: Create isolated test database with known datasets for statistics validation
- **Fixture Management**: Develop comprehensive test fixtures covering multiple accounts, instruments, and time periods
- **Mock Data Generation**: Generate realistic trade data for testing edge cases and performance scenarios
- **Test Categorization**: Organize tests into unit tests (individual methods), integration tests (dashboard accuracy), and regression tests

### Calculation Accuracy Validation
- **Mathematical Verification**: Validate win rate calculations ((wins / total trades) * 100) across all methods
- **P&L Aggregation**: Ensure consistent profit/loss summation logic using position-based calculations
- **Timeframe Accuracy**: Verify daily, weekly, and monthly aggregations match expected mathematical results
- **Cross-Method Consistency**: Compare results between `TradingLog_db` methods and `StatisticsRepository` methods

### Error Handling and Monitoring
- **Exception Management**: Implement proper error handling for division by zero, empty datasets, and invalid parameters
- **Logging Integration**: Use existing structured logging to track statistics calculation errors and performance
- **Data Validation**: Add input validation for date ranges, account IDs, and instrument parameters
- **Graceful Degradation**: Return appropriate default values when calculations cannot be completed

### Performance and Compatibility
- **Query Performance**: Ensure statistics queries leverage existing database indexes efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Handle large datasets without excessive memory usage during calculations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API contracts for dashboard and statistics routes
- **Cache Integration**: Leverage existing Redis cache for frequently accessed statistics data

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Test each statistics calculation method independently with known input/output pairs
- **Integration Test Suite**: Test complete dashboard and statistics page workflows for accuracy
- **Edge Case Testing**: Cover scenarios including empty data, single trades, date boundary conditions
- **Regression Testing**: Prevent future accuracy issues by testing against historical data snapshots
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure statistics calculations complete within acceptable time limits
