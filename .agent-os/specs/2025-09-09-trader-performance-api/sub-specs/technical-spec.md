# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-trader-performance-api/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-09
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Flask Blueprint Integration** - Create new blueprint following existing pattern (/statistics, /positions route structure)
- **Database Query Optimization** - Leverage existing SQLite WAL mode with aggressive indexing for sub-50ms response times
- **Redis Caching Layer** - Implement intelligent caching with 30-60 second TTL to reduce database load during frequent polling
- **Position-Based Calculation** - Integrate with existing position tracking system (quantity flow 0 → +/- → 0) rather than trade-by-trade analysis
- **Calendar Day/Week Logic** - Filter positions/trades by current calendar day (midnight to midnight) or week (Monday to Sunday) using timezone-aware datetime handling
- **JSON Response Format** - Return structured JSON with daily_pnl/weekly_pnl, total_trades, winning_trades, losing_trades fields
- **Error Handling** - Implement comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 500, 503)
- **Performance Monitoring** - Add logging and metrics collection consistent with existing structured logging patterns
- **Container Network Access** - Configure Flask to accept connections on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) for container-to-container communication
- **Gunicorn Compatibility** - Ensure endpoint works correctly with existing Gunicorn production deployment configuration

## Approach

### 1. Database Layer
- Utilize existing position tracking tables with proper indexing on date columns
- Implement optimized queries that filter by calendar day and week boundaries
- Leverage SQLite WAL mode for concurrent read performance
- Use date range queries for weekly calculations (Monday start to Sunday end)

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Redis-based caching with intelligent key generation based on date/week periods
- Separate cache keys for daily and weekly performance data
- Cache invalidation triggers on new trade data updates
- TTL configuration aligned with trading session timing (30-60 seconds)

### 3. API Design
- RESTful endpoints following existing Flask blueprint patterns (/daily and /weekly)
- Consistent error response format with existing API endpoints
- Performance-first design with sub-50ms target response time for both endpoints

## External Dependencies

- **Redis** - For caching layer (already configured in infrastructure)
- **SQLite** - Primary database with WAL mode (existing configuration)
- **Flask** - Web framework with blueprint architecture (existing)
- **Gunicorn** - WSGI server for production deployment (existing)
