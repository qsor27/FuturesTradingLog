**Dependencies:** Tasks 1.2, 1.4
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Service orchestrates validation workflows and result management
- Methods for on-demand validation, batch validation, and result retrieval
- Handles validation scheduling and result persistence
- Error handling and logging for validation failures
- Service integration tests covering all public methods

**Risk Assessment:** Medium - Service layer complexity manageable with proper design

#### Task 2.3: Create REST API Endpoints for Validation Operations
**Estimated Time:** 6 hours
**Dependencies:** Task 2.2
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- POST /api/validation/positions/{id} for single position validation
- POST /api/validation/batch for bulk validation operations
- GET /api/validation/results/{id} for validation result retrieval
- GET /api/validation/issues for integrity issue listing with filtering
- Proper HTTP status codes, error handling, and API documentation
- API integration tests covering all endpoints

**Risk Assessment:** Low - Standard REST API implementation

#### Task 2.4: Add Automated Repair Capabilities for Common Issues
**Estimated Time:** 10 hours
**Dependencies:** Tasks 1.2, 2.2
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automated repair for missing execution links
- Data correction for common timestamp and quantity mismatches
- Configurable repair strategies (conservative vs. aggressive)
- Audit trail for all automated repairs
- Comprehensive tests for repair scenarios with rollback capability

**Risk Assessment:** High - Automated data modification requires extensive testing and safeguards

#### Task 2.5: Implement Background Validation Job Scheduling
**Estimated Time:** 6 hours
**Dependencies:** Task 2.2
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Scheduled validation jobs for all positions (configurable frequency)
- Job queue management with proper error handling and retries
- Monitoring and alerting for job failures
- Performance optimization to avoid system impact during peak hours
- Integration with existing background job infrastructure

**Risk Assessment:** Medium - Job scheduling requires coordination with existing system jobs

### Phase 3 - User Interface & Optimization (Week 3)

#### Task 3.1: Create Integrity Validation Dashboard UI
**Estimated Time:** 12 hours
**Dependencies:** Tasks 2.2, 2.3
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard showing overall integrity health metrics
- Position-level integrity status with drill-down capabilities
