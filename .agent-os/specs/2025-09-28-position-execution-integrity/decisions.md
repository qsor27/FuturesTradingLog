## 2025-09-29: Position Execution Integrity Architecture

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Database Team, Performance Team

### Decision 1: Domain Service Architecture

**Context:** The position building system is critical for chart loading performance (15-50ms target) and any integrity validation must not disrupt this core functionality. The existing position service handles complex calculations and state management.

**Decision:** Create separate PositionExecutionIntegrityValidator domain service that operates independently from the core position building pipeline.

**Reasoning:**
- Separation of concerns ensures validation logic doesn't interfere with position calculations
- Independent service allows for isolated testing and deployment
- Enables validation to run at different cadences without affecting real-time operations
- Maintains clean architecture boundaries between core business logic and quality assurance

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** System modularity, reduced risk of performance degradation, easier testing and maintenance
- **Negative:** Additional complexity in service coordination, potential data consistency windows

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Database Design
**Stakeholders:** Database Team, Backend Team

### Decision 2: Database Design Strategy

**Context:** Need to track validation results, integrity metadata, and provide audit trails without impacting existing position data structures or query performance.

**Decision:** Implement new dedicated position_execution_validation table with enhanced referential integrity constraints on existing position-related tables.

**Reasoning:**
- Data isolation prevents validation metadata from cluttering core position tables
- Dedicated table enables efficient querying of validation history and results
- Enhanced constraints provide database-level integrity guarantees
- Separate schema allows for independent optimization and indexing strategies

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Clean data separation, comprehensive audit trail, database-enforced integrity
- **Negative:** Schema complexity increase, additional table maintenance overhead

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Integration Strategy
**Stakeholders:** Performance Team, Backend Team

### Decision 3: Hybrid Validation Approach

**Context:** Chart loading must maintain 15-50ms performance while ensuring comprehensive position execution integrity validation across all data scenarios.

**Decision:** Implement hybrid real-time + background validation strategy with performance-aware execution paths.

**Reasoning:**
- Real-time validation for critical path operations ensures immediate integrity
- Background validation provides comprehensive coverage without performance impact
- Performance-aware implementation allows dynamic adjustment based on system load
- Hybrid approach maximizes coverage while preserving user experience

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Performance preservation with comprehensive data quality assurance
- **Negative:** Increased resource usage, potential data freshness trade-offs in background validation

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Data Repair Strategy
**Stakeholders:** Data Team, Operations Team

### Decision 4: Conservative Automated Repair

**Context:** Integrity violations require resolution but automated repairs pose risks to financial trading data accuracy and system stability.

**Decision:** Implement conservative auto-repair system with dry-run default mode and manual approval required for critical data modifications.

**Reasoning:**
- Dry-run mode provides safe preview of repair operations
- Manual approval for critical issues ensures human oversight of financial data changes
- Conservative approach prioritizes data safety over automation convenience
- Graduated repair levels allow appropriate response to different severity issues

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Data safety assurance, audit trail for all repairs, balanced automation
- **Negative:** Reduced system autonomy, potential delays in issue resolution

**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Validation Scope
**Stakeholders:** Quality Assurance Team, Performance Team

### Decision 5: Comprehensive Validation Implementation

**Context:** Position execution integrity requires thorough validation of mathematical calculations, state transitions, and data relationships while maintaining system performance.

**Decision:** Implement comprehensive validation scope using existing position building algorithms with performance-optimized execution paths.

**Reasoning:**
- Reuse of existing algorithms ensures consistency with production calculations
- Comprehensive scope addresses all identified integrity scenarios
- Performance optimization prevents validation from becoming system bottleneck
- Complete coverage provides confidence in data quality assurance

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Complete integrity assurance, algorithm consistency, thorough quality coverage
- **Negative:** Resource overhead justified by critical importance of data accuracy in trading systems

## Implementation Notes

These architectural decisions collectively create a robust position execution integrity system that:
- Preserves critical system performance characteristics
- Provides comprehensive data quality assurance
- Maintains clean separation of concerns
- Ensures safe handling of financial trading data
- Balances automation with necessary human oversight

The decisions prioritize data accuracy and system stability while enabling the integrity validation capabilities required for reliable position tracking.
