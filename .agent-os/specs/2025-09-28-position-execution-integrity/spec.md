# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Position-Execution Integrity Validation
> Created: 2025-09-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Ensure absolute data integrity between positions and their constituent executions through comprehensive validation, automated reconciliation, and repair capabilities. This system will guarantee that every position in the trading log has complete and accurate execution data that comprises it.

## User Stories

1. **As a trader**, I want to be confident that every position I view shows complete execution data, so I can trust the accuracy of my profit/loss calculations and position analysis.

2. **As a system administrator**, I want automated detection of position-execution integrity issues, so I can be immediately notified when data inconsistencies occur and take corrective action.

3. **As a data analyst**, I want repair capabilities for orphaned executions and incomplete positions, so I can maintain clean and reliable trading data for analysis and reporting.

## Spec Scope

1. **Position-Execution Validation Engine** - Comprehensive validation system that checks every position has all required executions and verifies execution data completeness
2. **Automated Integrity Detection** - Background monitoring system that continuously scans for orphaned executions, incomplete positions, and data mismatches
3. **Data Repair and Reconciliation** - Automated repair capabilities for common integrity issues with manual override options for complex cases
4. **Integrity Reporting Dashboard** - Real-time dashboard showing data integrity status, issue counts, and repair history with drill-down capabilities
5. **Position Building Validation** - Integration with existing position building system to prevent integrity issues during data import and position creation

## Out of Scope

- Real-time market data feed validation
- Historical data migration from external trading platforms
- Cross-broker execution reconciliation
- Performance optimization for large datasets (beyond basic requirements)
- Advanced statistical analysis of integrity patterns

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Position Integrity Dashboard** - Browser-accessible dashboard showing real-time integrity status with ability to view detailed validation results for any position
2. **Automated Repair System** - Working repair functionality that can be triggered from the dashboard to fix common integrity issues with confirmation dialogs
3. **Validation API Endpoints** - RESTful API endpoints that allow programmatic access to run integrity checks and retrieve validation results for integration testing
