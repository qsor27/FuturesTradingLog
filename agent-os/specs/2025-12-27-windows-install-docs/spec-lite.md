# Spec Summary (Lite)

Update Windows installation documentation to achieve complete feature parity with Docker deployment. Include all environment variables from docker-compose.yml, create PowerShell auto-update scripts equivalent to Watchtower, document full NSSM service configuration, and provide explicit file paths with both generic templates (C:\ProgramData\FuturesTradingLog) and real-world examples (C:\Projects\FuturesTradingLog, C:\Containers\FuturesTradingLog\data).
