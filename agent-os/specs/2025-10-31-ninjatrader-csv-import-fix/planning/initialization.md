## Date
2025-10-31

## User's Original Request
"help me fix the import process. We have some different specs that have tried to resolve it but they haven't worked. Just constant issues imported automatically when files arrive as well as when they are updated. we need a cohesive system that can ingest trade execution data from ninjatrader throughout the day via the CSV's that we have built with the indicator."

## Initial Understanding
This spec is about creating a cohesive system to automatically ingest trade execution data from NinjaTrader CSV files throughout the day, addressing ongoing issues with automatic import when files arrive and are updated.

## Status
Requirements gathering in progress
