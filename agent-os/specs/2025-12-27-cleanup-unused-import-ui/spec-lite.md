# Spec Summary (Lite)

Remove deprecated manual import UI from the /trades page (Step 1 and Step 2 sections) and eliminate the /upload page entirely. This cleanup reflects the transition to automated imports via the Daily Import Scheduler at 2:05pm PT, providing a cleaner user interface while preserving all automated import functionality.
